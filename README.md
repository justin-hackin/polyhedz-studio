# Polyhedral Net Factory 

A desktop application for the fabrication of interlocking pyramid nets which form stellations and other geometric polyhedra.

NOTE: KDE users will experience issues with Alt-dragging modifiers in Texture Editor due to the window manager's behaviour.  These issues can be addressed by changing/removing the modifier for all applications or disable the modifier for this application only as discussed in [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/584730/how-can-i-disable-alt-mouse-default-behavior-in-kde).
